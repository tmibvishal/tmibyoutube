    <br>c.) We reserve the right to take appropriate action against any user for any unauthorized use of the Website,
    including civil, criminal and injunctive redress and the termination of any user's use of the Website. Any use of
    the Website and our computer systems not authorized by these Terms is a violation of these Terms and certain
    international, foreign and domestic criminal and civil laws.

    <br>d.) In addition to termination of the grant of use of the Website, any violation of this Agreement, including
    the provisions of this Section 5, shall subject you to liquidated damages of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for each
    violation. In the event that your violation results in legal action (whether against you or against us by any party)
    or physical or emotional harm to any party, you shall be subject to liquidated damages of One Hundred and Fifty
    Thousand Dollars ($150,000) for each violation. We may, in our discretion, assign any such damage claim or portion
    thereof to a third party that has been wronged by your conduct. These liquidated damages provisions are not a
    penalty, but instead an attempt by the Parties to reasonably ascertain the amount of actual damage that could occur
    from such a violation. You acknowledge and agree that the amount of these liquidated damages is a minimum and that
    if actual damages are greater you shall be liable for the greater amount. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds
    that these liquidated damages are unenforceable to any extent, then the liquidated damages shall be lowered only by
    the extent necessary for them to be enforceable.
